              In today's fast-paced world, we often forget one crucial aspect of
              successâ€”our well-being. At Respiro, we believe that productivity
              and health go hand in hand. That's why we've created a tool that
              helps you not only manage your time but also prioritize your
              health through mindful breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Respiro, inspired by the Latin word for "breath," is more than
              just a time management app. It's your companion in building
              healthier work habits. Whether you're using renowned techniques
              like Pomodoro or creating your own rhythm with custom timers,
              Respiro is here to help you stay balanced, focused, and energized.
